# VM-Language-Code
This project was originally created for a custom computer built in Minecraft(which isn't build yet). It defines a simple assembly-like language intended to run on that virtual machine. The provided Python code acts as an emulator, allowing programs to be tested and executed outside of Minecraft in a simulated environment.
